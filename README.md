# SNPSeek Backend Code Repository

Welcome to the **SNPSeek Backend** repository! This repository contains the backend services and infrastructure that support the **SNPSeek** project. The backend handles data processing, storage, and serves as the backbone for SNP data analysis and visualization.

The backend focuses on efficiently processing large SNP datasets, storing them in a relational database, and providing API endpoints for data access, transformation, and visualization. It ensures that users can seamlessly interact with SNP data through APIs and makes the project scalable and extensible for future integrations.

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

The SNPSeek backend provides:
- **Data Processing**: Handling raw SNP data and transforming it into usable formats.
- **API Services**: Exposing RESTful API endpoints to interact with SNP data.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the backend is able to handle large datasets, making it suitable for high-volume SNP analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Database Interaction**: Scripts for storing and querying SNP data from the database.
- **Data Transformation**: Preprocessing and transformation of SNP data into usable formats for analysis and visualization.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides access to SNP data, metadata, and processing results.
